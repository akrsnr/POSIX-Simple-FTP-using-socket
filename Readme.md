POSIX Simple FTP System using Socket!
===================


I'm Soner. It is my final project for System Programming course. It is a communication system known as server-client. You can send multiple files from clients to server. I have used POSIX Thread to connect more than one client.

> **Tip:** You can send kill signal using <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>. It is handled well.
